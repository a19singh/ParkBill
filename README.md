A PARKING RECEIPT GENERATOR !

## Introduction 

Vehicle parking has become a serious challenge for the country. To tackle this problem, different kinds of parking lots have been designed by the government or some private organization, such as bay parking, multistory parking, etc. But due to low manpower or some technical glitch present in the system of management, people are somewhat facing problems. Long lines for parking receipts or unfair charging for parking are the best examples that can be considered. This does not only lead to physical inconvenience to a person, but also mental stress and sometimes anxiety. 

Keeping all types of inconveniences and in mind, presenting our project with the objective of providing a better and modern solution for generating the parking receipts.
